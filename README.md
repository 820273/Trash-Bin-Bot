# Trash-Bin-Bot
Our assignment for our coding class.

Inspired by: https://projecthub.arduino.cc/ashraf_minhaj/c81effad-d583-40bb-9d20-808803efbdf2

# Components 
1. Cardboard + Tape (the more cardboard you use the bigger the trash can will be)
2. Arduino Uno
3. Breadboard
4. HCSR04 Ultrasound Sensor
5. Servo + Servo arm
6. Electric Wires


# Function
this arduino-contraption uses an ultrasound sensor to measure if anything is within 25 centimeters in front of it. when it sees that something is within those 25 centimeters, it will make the servo -which has an extension of cardboard taped onto it- turn up, which will in turn push the lid up. after 1 second, it will beep 3 times -each 0.25 seconds apart- and than close again.
